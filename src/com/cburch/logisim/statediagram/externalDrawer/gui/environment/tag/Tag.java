/**
 * A tag is simply an interface that can be applied to an object to indicate
 * that it satisfies some sort of property. The intention is for a tag object to
 * have absolutely no methods to implement. In this way a tag object functions
 * much like the bitfield vectors of yore for identifying them with particular
 * characteristics, but without the inconvinience of having particular bits tied
 * to certain values that absolutely everybody and his mother had to be made
 * aware of. A tag object may simply be something that implements <CODE>Tag</CODE>
 * only to indicate that it has no tag.
